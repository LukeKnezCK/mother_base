## Development

Below is the timeline for the development of this project in all aspects (Code, Art, etc).

### Mockups

To begin development I first created mockups to get a basic idea of the layout and look/feel of the site.

I drew up designs for both mobile and desktop.

#### Desktop Designs

#### Mobile Designs

Some of the assets and designs of the final site differ pretty significantly from the mockups since these were mainly for a general idea.

### Voxel Modeling 

I wanted to create some sort of 3D art to showcase and act sort of as a logo for the website. I created a couple of models before deciding on a final selection.

Before deciding on a voxel style I initally pursued the idea of creating a high-poly model.

Eventually I switched to using MagicaVoxel to create models in an art style I felt more of an affinity for.

Below is couple of screenshots of the modeling process.

The whole process of creating the model took about 3 days of on and off work. Below is a render of the final product.

I also made a couple other models, though they are much simpler and didnt take nearly as long.
